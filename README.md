# Meadow-and-road
Conversion from lawn to street

This project was implemented with the Netbeans development environment.
The project consists in creating a main square window where the green boxes will 
appear at the edges that represent the lawn class. At the center of the figure, 
instead, will be gray squares representing the street class. When the user clicks on
"lawn" the box will become "street" and if he clicks on a "road" box the box will become "lawn".
Subsequently when the user will click on the "AddAuto" button and then on a road type box a 
red dot will appear.
When the user clicks on the "start" button of the main window, another window will appear with some buttons
